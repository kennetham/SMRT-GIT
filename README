SMRT Git
==

Inspired by [MetroGit](https://github.com/vbarbaresi/MetroGit), which shows Paris' metro lines in the form of a Git commit history, I created a Singaporean version. This Git repository contains all the MRT stations in Singapore (excluding LRT).

- And other git commands and tools such as `gitk` and `git log --all --graph`.

### Generating the Commits

Simply do:
```
$ ./script.sh
```

This script is incredibly meta. It wipes out the current git repository, adds itself and `README.md` to master, then proceeds to generate the commits on other branches.

If you want to push to a remote repository, modify the remote at the end of `script.sh` and append `push` to the generation command:
```
$ ./script.sh push
```
